# Advanced Fuel Consumption Calculator

## Description
This C program calculates total fuel required for a flight including:
- Trip fuel based on distance and aircraft consumption rate
- Contingency fuel (% of trip fuel)
- Alternate airport fuel
- Final reserve fuel  

It simulates a simplified flight planning calculation like in a Flight Management System (FMS).

## Tech Used
- Language: C
- IDE: Any C compiler (GCC, Code::Blocks, online compiler.)

## Input Example
Enter flight distance in NM: 5678
Enter aircraft fuel consumption rate (kg/NM): 2.5
Enter contingency fuel percentage (e.g., 5 for 5%): 5
Enter alternate airport fuel (kg): 250
Enter final reserve fuel (kg): 500

## Output Example
Trip Fuel: 14195.00 kg
Contingency Fuel: 709.75 kg
Alternate Fuel: 250.00 kg
Final Reserve Fuel: 500.00 kg
Total Fuel Required: 15654.75 kg
